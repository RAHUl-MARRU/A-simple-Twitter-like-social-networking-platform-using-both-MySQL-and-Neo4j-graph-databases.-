Database Systems

# Overview


The aim of this project is to design and implement a simple Twitter-like social networking platform using both MySQL and Neo4j graph databases. Students are expected to gain an understanding of all the steps involved in using both relational and graph databases for a practical application.


# Requirements

• Each user can sign up with their name, lastname, and email. 

• A user may choose to “follow'' other users.

• A user may post a feed.

• Each feed might have zero or more comments.

• A feed may be liked by a user. 

• A feed may be re-tweeted.

• A comment or a feed should be able to deleted by the owner when needed.

• There is no restriction of the number of characters for a feed or comment.

• Login page – a person should be able to sign up. 

• Main page – displays news feeds according to the network of a user (his/her feeds and people 
he/she follows). 

• Profile page – list user’s profile information, the people he/she follows and feeds of that user.

# Future works
Implementing the mini web application(dashboard) on this sample twitter database with some 
plsql procedures, triggers and functions created in the backend of application that help user to 
design clone twitter application.
